# Design — Lean model of graded Transpose

## toolchain

`lean-toolchain`: `leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0-rc2`, taken verbatim from the
Mathlib-recommended bootstrap (`lake +leanprover-community/mathlib4:lean-toolchain
new transpose_lean math`); not hand-picked.

Mathlib pin (from `lake-manifest.json`, `require` entry `mathlib`,
`inputRev = "v4.34.0-rc2"`): commit `85e3a25e006c35636f0e53b0e9296caca2685bc0`.

Cache command: `lake exe cache get` (the `math` template also runs this as
part of `lake new`, so the very first `lake build` in this repo already had
the Mathlib oleans in place).

Build times (`make verify`, i.e. `lake build`), measured on this step:

- Cold (`.lake/build` for the project's own targets removed, Mathlib cache
  from `lake exe cache get` still present): see `tmp/plan/metrics.jsonl`,
  row `verify-floor`, field `note`.
- Warm (nothing changed, cache present): see the same row.

> **Provisional.** The exact wall-clock numbers depend on this machine and
> this network path to the Mathlib cache blob store. Revisit if a later
> step's CI run reports a materially different floor.

### Lint configuration

The Mathlib `math` template enables `weak.linter.mathlibStandardSet`, whose
rules assume files destined for Mathlib itself. Three are turned off in
`lakefile.toml` because they contradict this project rather than describe
it: `style.header` (wants a Mathlib copyright block in every file),
`hashCommand` (forbids `#guard`/`#eval`, which `docs/RULES.md` *requires* in
every test file so that definitions are known to compute and not merely
typecheck), and `dupNamespace` (flags `Graded.Graded`, the name this plan
specifies). The rest of the set is left on. A green build is expected to be
a silent build; a warning means someone introduced one.

## cpp-counterpart

The grade is `error_set<Es...>`: a set of error *types*, ordered by
inclusion, joined by union; ∅ is the unit. It is a nominal type, not a bare
pack. Canonicalization is *type-level identity*: `error_set<A,B>` and
`error_set<B,A>` are the same type, via a public alias delegating to a
sorted detail carrier. An instance holds **one** error value, whose type is
in the set; value equality is variant-style.

The carrier at grade `Es` is `expected<T, error_set<Es...>>`; at grade ∅ it
is **bare `T`** (decided for client-API risk reasons), so ∅-grade is a
different C++ type from `expected<T, error_set<>>`.

Subsumption `Es ⊆ Es'` is an implicit conversion of the carrier.

`bind` produces the *union* grade; `pure` produces grade ∅.

The applicative typeclass instance for a monad is stated to be identical to
(not merely derivable from) the monad instance.

`traverse` is shape-preserving over ranges and over tuples.

Typeclass instances are duck-typed "gadgets" needing only a couple of
functions; no law checking exists in the C++ machinery; std types are the
intended test probes if a law harness is added.

Only `error_set` is intended as a grade for now; the design should not make
it the *only possible* grade.

## grade

`Graded.Grade Err := Finset Err`, for `[DecidableEq Err]`: a grade is a
finite set of error kinds. `Err` stands in for the universe of C++ error
types (see [cpp-counterpart](#cpp-counterpart)); `DecidableEq` is what lets
Lean form a `Finset` over it at all — the closest thing to "these are
distinct types" that Lean needs spelled out, where C++ gets it for free
from nominal typing.

`bot := ∅`, `join g h := g ∪ h`; the order is `⊆` (Finset's own
`PartialOrder`), read as "subset" rather than translated to `≤`, so a C++
reader sees the relation they already know.

Every pomonoid property `Graded.Grade.join`/`bot`/`⊆` has is a *separately
named* lemma in `Graded/Grade.lean`, each proved by one Mathlib `Finset`
lemma, never re-derived inline, so a later step can cite the property by
name:

- `join_assoc`, `join_comm`, `join_idem`
- `bot_join`, `join_bot`
- `le_join_left`, `le_join_right`, `join_le`, `join_mono`
- `le_refl'`, `le_trans'`, `bot_le`
- `join_eq_right_of_le`

Five of these carry a `/-- PROPERTY: ... -/` docstring tag —
`associative`, `commutative`, `idempotent`, `unit` (on both `bot_join` and
`join_bot`), `order` (on both `le_refl'` and `le_trans'`) — which is what
[oracle-export](../tmp/plan/step-oracle-export.md) greps to find which laws
depend on which property.

> **Provisional.** `Grade` is deliberately *not* registered as a Mathlib
> `SemilatticeSup`/`OrderedCommMonoid` instance, so that lemma use stays
> greppable: an instance would let `simp` reach for these properties
> invisibly, which defeats the point of naming them. Revisit if a later
> step needs Mathlib's lattice API for a proof that is otherwise long.

## carrier

`Graded.Graded (g : Grade Err) (α : Type v)` (in `Graded/Carrier.lean`): an
`ok` holding a value of `α`, or an `err` holding one error value together
with a proof of its membership in `g`. Models `expected<T,
error_set<Es...>>` ([cpp-counterpart](#cpp-counterpart)); the membership
proof is what stands in for "one error whose *type* is in the set."

`map : (α → β) → Graded g α → Graded g β`, with laws `map_id`, `map_comp`.
The grade does not appear in `map`'s type — functors are oblivious to
grading, true by construction, not by proof.

`emptyEquiv : Graded (Grade.bot : Grade Err) α ≃ α` settles the ∅-grade
question honestly: `Graded ∅ α` is a different *type* from `α` (its `err`
constructor exists, merely uninhabited — `Finset.notMem_empty` closes that
case), but is *isomorphic* to it, and the isomorphism is natural in `map`
(`map_emptyEquiv`). That naturality is what "bare `T` is safe at grade ∅"
means: every operation on the two representations agrees, not just their
storage. C++'s implicit conversion at grade ∅ asserts the same
identification without proof.

`cast (h : g = g') : Graded g α → Graded g' α`, with `cast_rfl`,
`cast_cast`, lets later steps state laws "modulo grade equalities."

`DecidableEq (Graded g α)` (given `DecidableEq α`, `DecidableEq Err`): the
membership proof is a `Prop`, hence proof-irrelevant, so two `err` values
compare equal exactly when their error values do — mirroring how C++
variant equality never has to look at "how" the alternative's admissibility
was established, because that fact is compile-time and already erased.

The first consumer, `Examples/Validation.lean`: `parseNat : String →
Graded {E.parse} Nat` and `checkRange : Nat → Graded {E.range} Nat`,
composed by hand (`match`, no `bind` yet) into `validate : String →
Graded {E.parse, E.range} Nat` — the union grade and each `err`'s
membership proof assembled explicitly at the call site. Marked
`REPLACED-BY: bind` at its definition; [monad-laws] replaces this
composition.

## subsumption

`widen (h : g ⊆ g') : Graded g α → Graded g' α` (in `Graded/Widen.lean`):
the order half of the pomonoid made computational — an `ok` passes through
untouched, an `err`'s membership proof is carried along `h`. Models the
C++ implicit conversion `expected<T, error_set<Es...>> → expected<T,
error_set<Es'...>>` for `Es ⊆ Es'` ([cpp-counterpart](#cpp-counterpart)).

Four laws, each citing the [grade](#grade) lemma it needs:

- `widen_refl` (`Grade.le_refl'`): widening along the reflexive inclusion
  is the identity.
- `widen_widen` (`Grade.le_trans'`): widening twice agrees with widening
  once along the composite inclusion — the conversion path's endpoints
  determine the result, not the path.
- `widen_map`: naturality — mapping before or after widening agrees. No
  named [grade](#grade) lemma is needed; this is a property of `widen`
  and `map` alone.
- `widen_irrel`: proof irrelevance — any two proofs of `g ⊆ g'` widen a
  given value identically. Provable by `rfl`, because `⊆` on a `Finset`
  is a `Prop` and Lean's definitional equality already erases proof
  content; stating it as a theorem is what turns "the conversion path
  doesn't matter" from a convention C++ relies on into something Lean
  checks rather than assumes.

`widen_cast (e : g = g') (h : g' ⊆ g'') : widen h (cast e x) = widen (e ▸
h) x` settles the interaction between the two ways of changing a grade:
proving `⊆` (`widen`) and proving `=` (`cast`). It followed from `subst e;
rfl` on the first attempt — no `grind` loop was needed, contrary to this
step's own prediction that it would be fiddly.

Together these four laws (plus `widen_map`) say: subsumption is a
*functor* from the poset `(Grade, ⊆)` to endofunctors — the C++
conversion sequence is required to satisfy this and does, by these
theorems.

`fromEmpty : α → Graded g α := widen Grade.bot_le ∘ emptyEquiv.symm`
(citing `Grade.bot_le`) makes the bare-`T` handoff — "you can pass a bare
`T` where a graded value is expected" — a proved composite: go through
the ∅-collapse ([carrier](#carrier)'s `emptyEquiv`), then widen along
`∅ ⊆ g`. `fromEmpty_eq_ok : fromEmpty a = .ok a` is `rfl`.

`Examples/Validation.lean` gains a third stage, `logIt : Nat → Graded
{E.io} Unit`, and a `#guard` widening `parseNat`'s failure from grade
`{E.parse}` into `{E.parse, E.range, E.io}` and comparing it, via
`decide`, to the same failure constructed directly at that grade.

## monad

`Graded.pure (a : α) : Graded (Grade.bot : Grade Err) α := .ok a` and
`Graded.bind (x : Graded g α) (f : α → Graded h β) : Graded (Grade.join g
h) β` (in `Graded/Monad.lean`) model C++ `and_then`: the result grade is
the *union* of the input's grade and the continuation's. `bind` needs only
the order half of the pomonoid — `Grade.le_join_right` to widen the
continuation's result up to the union on the success path,
`Grade.le_join_left` to inject the input's own error on the failure path
— neither branch needs `join_comm`; the two sides of the union are kept
apart by which one-sided inclusion lemma reaches them, not by commuting
anything.

Five theorems, each citing the [grade](#grade) property it needs:

- `bind_pure_left` (unit, `bot_join`): `pure` on the left of `bind` is the
  continuation, up to `∅ ∪ h = h`.
- `bind_pure_right` (unit, `join_bot`): `pure` on the right is the
  original value, up to `g ∪ ∅ = g`.
- `bind_assoc` (associative, `join_assoc`): `bind` re-associates up to
  `(g ∪ h) ∪ j = g ∪ (h ∪ j)`.
- `bind_map` (unit, `join_bot`): `bind x (pure ∘ f) = map f x` up to
  `g ∪ ∅ = g` — the functor is the monad's functor.
- `bind_widen` (order, `join_mono` + `le_refl'`): subsumption commutes
  with `bind`; no `cast` at all, since widening produces an *inclusion*,
  not an equation, between the two sides' grades.

**Cast direction.** Every law with a `cast` states it as `cast
(Grade.<lemma> …) (<the compound bind/join expression>) = <the simpler
expression>`, always applying the pomonoid lemma in the direction it is
already stated in `Graded/Grade.lean` — never `.symm`. Concretely: `cast`
is applied to whichever side's grade is literally the `join`-expression
the named lemma's left-hand side matches (`Grade.join Grade.bot h`,
`Grade.join g Grade.bot`, `Grade.join (Grade.join g h) j`), transporting
it down to the grade the lemma's right-hand side names. This was a
free choice — the reverse direction (cast the simpler side up, with
`.symm`) typechecks equally well — but this one reads as "the messier
expression collapses to the tidy one," which matched every proof's
natural shape and meant no `.symm` was ever needed, at the law
statements or at their use sites in the tests.

**Verdict on the `cast` decision ([carrier](#carrier)):** tolerable, not
dominating. Three small generic transport lemmas — `cast_ok`, `cast_err`,
`cast_widen` (the mirror of `Widen.widen_cast`), each one `subst e; rfl`
— handled every occurrence of `cast` meeting a constructor or a `widen`
across all five theorems; no proof needed more than that plus `cases` on
the scrutinee(s) and one closing `rw`. Rough count: of the ~45 lines of
proof text, perhaps a third is `cast`/`widen`-shuffling (the `change`
statements that spell out the fully-reduced goal) and the rest is
ordinary case analysis. Nothing here suggests revisiting the provisional
decision.
